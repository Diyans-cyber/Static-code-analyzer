# 🛠️ Static Code Analyzer

## 📌 Project Overview
A **Static Code Analyzer** inspects source code **without executing it** to detect potential issues, bugs, and areas of improvement.  
This project implements a simple **static code analysis tool** that helps developers write **cleaner, more efficient, and error-free code**.  

The analyzer scans the code for:
- Syntax issues
- Code smells (unused variables, long lines, etc.)
- Complexity warnings
- Basic security vulnerabilities
- Style guide violations (PEP8 in Python)

---

## 🎯 Features
- 📄 Reads and analyzes source code (e.g., `.py` files)
- 🔍 Detects:
  - Missing or unused imports
  - Unused variables/functions
  - Long lines or functions
  - Poor naming conventions
  - Hardcoded values
- 📊 Provides a report of findings with line numbers
- ⚡ Lightweight and runs locally (no external API required)
